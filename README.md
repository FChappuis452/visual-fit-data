# visual-fit-data
In this project I will use the Django framework, and google's Fitness API to help visualize Google Fit data. Currently this project is best viewed in a browser window

It will feature having to login into google to authenticate yourself and then it will pull the data from the API.  

Some limitiation that the API has is that it can only retrieve 90 days worth of data.

It is currently still under construction and is a live version is hosted on https://visual-fit-data.herokuapp.com/fitness/
Due to the limitation of a free heroku account, the page might take a few seconds to become responsive. This is because the free version of 
heroku "powers down" when not being actively used.
